\title{Use locality-sensitive hashing to get combinations of sentences which contain words which are in the same minhash bucket}
\usage{
textrank_candidates_lsh(x, sentence_id, minhashFUN, bands)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character vector of words or terms}

\item{sentence_id}{a character vector of identifiers of sentences where the words/terms provided in \code{x} are part of the sentence.
The length of \code{sentence_id} should be the same length of \code{x}}

\item{minhashFUN}{a function which returns a minhash of a character vector. See the examples or look at \code{\link[textreuse]{minhash_generator}}}

\item{bands}{integer indicating to break down the minhashes in \code{bands} number of bands. Mark that
the number of minhash signatures should always be a multiple of the number of local sensitive hashing bands. See the example}
}
\value{
a data.frame with 2 columns textrank_id_1 and textrank_id_2 containing identifiers of sentences \code{sentence_id}
which contained terms in the same minhash bucket.
This data.frame can be used as input in the \code{\link{textrank_sentences}} algorithm.
}
\description{
This functionality is usefull if there are a lot of sentences and most of the sentences have no overlapping
words in there. In order not to compute the jaccard distance among all possible combinations of sentences as is
done by using \code{\link{textrank_candidates_all}}, we can reduce the combinations of sentences by using the Minhash algorithm.
This function sets up the combinations of sentences which are in the same Minhash bucket.
}
\examples{
library(textreuse)
lsh_probability(h = 1000, b = 500, s = 0.1) # A 10 percent Jaccard overlap will be detected well

minhash <- minhash_generator(n = 1000, seed = 123456789)

data(joboffer)
terminology <- subset(joboffer, upos \%in\% c("NOUN", "ADJ"), select = c("sentence_id", "lemma"))
candidates <- textrank_candidates_lsh(x = terminology$lemma, sentence_id = terminology$sentence_id,
                                      minhashFUN = minhash, bands = 500)
head(candidates)
